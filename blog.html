		<p> WEEK 0 </p>

			Ahh…Yes… We again find ourselves at the onset of new academic year. It is the time that we briefly delude ourselves with the typical notions of grandiosity that such times inspire. I for one already know that I will get up early, go to the gym, floss my teeth, and not watch Legend of Korra until 2:00 AM.  Instead, I will push onward with my goals ad nauseum and dedicate ecclesiastical amounts of time to each of my classes while simultaneously not missing a single social event or a demonstrably verbose, grammatically incoherent run on sentence.
			<p></p>
	 		College is a time to learn about balancing your life… Specifically, it is the time to learn that balancing your life is impossible. Fear not my ENP-162 classmates, we can give any unavoidable problem over to our future selves knowing that they will have none of our flaws. Indeed, our future selves will enrich this universe by curing cancer, colonizing the cosmos, and finally getting a million new followers on twitter. 
	 		<p></p>
			I hope you find that my blog provides your days with a menial morsel of wit meticulously manufactured from my mind made, minted, and meant for your mastication.

		<p> WEEK 1 </p>

			<p>
				This week, our class has three core tasks: Stating our thoughts on automation, making a digital portfolio, and better understanding Concepts of Operations also referred to as CONOPS—a classic instance of an acronym obfuscating a concept (or as I call it OBFCON). I began work with great haste, allowing no more than 3 to 4 days’ worth of rest before attempting to surmount this herculean task. I first read the 5-page CONOPS document on canvas but the OBFCON of CONOPS had my head looking like a mobius strip. Despite this initial twist, I was undaunted. I read through the packet once more at a third the speed I had originally read the document at and discovered, upon this closer look, a wealth of information had been revealed to me. 
			</p>

			<p>
				First and foremost, CONOPS appears to be a methodology to allow user-centered design to take a front seat by including clearer guidelines on what a products or projects objectives, key markets, and risks are. CONOPS can include what are the major phases of a project or task and further break down each step in a task. CONOPS serves as a manifesto that allows everyone, developers and consumers to be on the same page. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One can think of CONOPS as a living charter for a product or project. It should be built by all departments and verified across the board. It is a form of an outline with evaluations to pass, safety features to test, basic operating advice. Much like an outline for a story, a CONOPS must be completed before producing a product. CONOPS let you notice hookups and issues far before they manifest themselves in the projects plan. The projects scope, description, priorities, method, contributors, glossary, and acronyms should be part of the CONOPS. 
			</p>

				I had finished my reading for the week and was motivated by the progress I had made. I wanted to continue along my academic journey and find a blogging website without losing focus. I readily reacted swiftly switching tasks to undercut undue visual vicissitudes when Wes broke my train of thought (and letters) with a dastardly request, “Yo. You tryna watch Legend of Korra?”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I inhaled through closed teeth, sighed, and then responded with the simple gravitas of one whose march for penance has come all too soon, “Sure.”
			</p>

			<p>
 				After what seemed to me to be the briefest of pauses but was, in practice, several hours, I returned to work in an attempt to find the perfect website to host my melodramatic blog. I began scouring the internet for a site that could match the splendor of my illustrious design history. The first website I looked at was WIX. However, since WIX has enough money to spend an absolute fortune on advertising, I recognized they were probably ripping off their clients. I paused for a moment upon this realization and then removed WIX from my consideration entirely. With this eminent option down, I had to pursue more obscure websites. After considering several other options, I settled on none other than Tufts Trunk. I figured the archaic, aging, and aggravating platform had merely been an ugly duckling. Indeed, it may have been a horrific platform for scheduling classes, changing events, and posting homework. However, as a blogging platform it truly rivaled the best! 
 			</p>

 			<p>
				Obviously, I’m kidding. Trunk is, has, and always will be the worst software Tufts has forced me to use. I picked Canvas. It seemed much friendlier and, assuming Prof. Intriligator Ok’s this style of a blog, that’s were this week 1’s story ends.
			</p>

			<p>
				BUTTT wait, there is more!! I recently learned that these blog posts are also supposed to be about themes that have been covered in class. Specifically, this week’s theme is automation and what systems should or can be automated to improve our general existence. I always viewed automation as a potential existential threat to humanity. That said, I am aware that the early days of automation will be a paradise. Cars that drive themselves, robots that cook for me, and software fixes my grammar. However, at what point does automation change from a convenience to a prison. I will reference Stephen Mitchell’s translation of Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching, “They enjoy the labor of their hands and don’t waste time inventing labor-saving machines.” Now, to me, this line is rings as a cautionary tale against flippant automation. The point of the verse, as I see it, is that we should consider how all new technology could alter what it means to be human. Automation in certain areas is spectacular, convenient, and cheap. However, pursued to its extent, automation could destroy our current style of existence by devaluing our passions and potentially stripping away meaning from humanity. We will cheer as each new step of our lives gets automated. However, at the end of the line, if everything is automated for you, what can you do. I don’t paint; my automated robot paints. I don’t make music; AI software makes music. I don’t research compounds for drug development, it’s been automated. I don’t program or design automation machines, that too has been automated. I don’t even shop. The algorithms know what I want and order it for me before I even think. If pursued to an extreme extent, automation will rob us of all that makes our life a life. Struggle and labor are not enemies of mankind, but sources from which we derive meaning (we just want to be struggling and doing labor that we like).
			</p>

			<p>
				Yes, I know that the point when this happens is far, far off in the future, but the fact that it could happen to humanity is a little wild. I too will celebrate automation until the part of my life that I derive joy and meaning from gets automated as well. We all want a world where everything can be automated except our passion, but that’s not how this story ends. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In short: We all know what we would do if we had all the money in the world, but what if we had all the money in the world and there was nothing to do?

		<h3> </h3>
		<p> WEEK 3 </p>
			<p>
				The week’s homework was to focus was on automating a part of our blog. I do not believe I have experienced a project as frustrating as this in years. To say that placing bamboo under my fingernails would have been preferential to figuring out automation on canvas is to put it mildly. We were informed that IFTTT could help us with our assignment. Regrettably, I was unable to use IFTTT successfully. For me, IFTTT was tantamount to a survival kit filled with dehydrated water. That’s not to say IFTTT is irredeemable. IFTTT is an exquisite automation website…If you work with one of the six websites they designed applications for. If you use a program that is not on the aforementioned list, you will find yourself stuck in the middle of a frozen lake formed from the tears of the damned. Surprisingly cute poets aside (Oh, Vergil…), IFTTT did not appear to work well on canvas so I began looking for alternatives.
				Thankfully, I am incredibly gifted when it comes to overestimating my skills. As such, I decided that it would be child’s play to teach myself html and build a new personalized website. After starting on this endeavor, I quickly realized I was correct. Coding html is like child’s play… the movie. After an hour and 28 minutes of unsuccessfully convincing my friends that my computer was a sentient demon bent on killing me, I was able to construct a website. Even better, it looks decent… like, it’s not going to win award… but… I mean… you try building an entire website with no… fine, it’s… it’s a work in progress.
				Having built a new website, it was time to begin my automation homework. I decided to place a button on my website that would re-direct someone to my comment section on canvas and automatically leave a comment praising my blog. Sample of this comment below:
			</P>
			<p>
				It is by serendipitous chance that I was assigned to your blog. However, first and foremost, I want to let you know that your blog has touched my heart in a way that few authors in literary history have been able to accomplish. It is unusual for someone as marble constant as I to say that my life has been genuinely improved by a work of art. Your extensive vocabulary has changed my perspective on all preconceived limits of the English language. To say that you are a modern-day Mozart does a disservice to the depths of your talent. I feel indebted to you and decided to leave this internet comment praising your work. Indeed, others will come to hold you as the greatest of the greats. Your name will be spoken among the likes of Mark Twain, T.S. Eliot, and M. Knight Shyamalan (Oh man… What a twist!). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, this blog is perfect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I would give it a 5/7.
 
 			<p>
				However, after several attempts of hacking canvas to display this message, I discovered that the webpage has surprisingly good security. I instead decided to include a button that would automatically hack a comp-20 lab to reveal a hidden phrase. Feel free to see this phrase for yourself by visiting the ENP-162 page on my website.
				Now, onto this week’s main blog topic: HTA. HTA stands for Hierarchical Task Analysis and it is used in human machine systems (and you I thought I was verbose). Personally, I find that HTA is a very helpful way to break down complicated tasks to find areas/stages that are fit for automation. I really enjoy HTA and find it to be an extremely useful skill. In fact, I’m trying to bring HTA into more of my daily life! Whether it is my math, code, or writing, I tend to blaze through too quickly and make a host of errors. I’m even liable to forget a period However, HTA helps slow my mind down and forces me to pay attention to each of the steps needed to get from point A to point B.
				The key difficulty in HTA is that, when pursued to an extreme extent, it can result in the big picture getting lost in the detail. I struggle to understand how simple I should go with each of the steps. For example, in a Keurig machine, I might say take a pod out of the cabinet. However, this simple action could be further broken down into the act of reaching for a pod, searching for the pod, and bringing the pod back to the device. Furthermore, each of these three steps could be broken into three steps and those three into three more steps. Suddenly, you have gone too far and are describing the act of moving your eyes towards the cabinet or which muscle groups you are firing!
				Of course, I’m blowing this a little out of proportion. However, it often is hard to decide what step in HTA is too specific. As I continue through this class, I hope to hone my skills on what needs to be explained or broken down in a process and what I can assume is known to a user.
				Overall, I find HTA’s greatest strength lies in making the unmanageable manageable. Many tasks sound impossible, but, when you break them down into smaller steps, you can accomplish just about anything.
